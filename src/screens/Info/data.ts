    'Moonbeam and Solana. Each step of expansion will be released only after the previous will be stabilized and ' +

    'To achieve all these goals we have to change the established gambling platform development approach. ' +
    'Most gambling platforms support only the betting in the selected blockchain native token. For gambling platforms ' +
    'in Ethereum this is ETH, for Binance Smart Chain this is BNB and so on. This structure works well only if you ' +
    'don’t want to evolve and the selected blockchain is enough for you, but for a multi-blockchain ecosystem it ' +
    'would be too restrictive. Due to this fact we’ve decided to create our own BETS multi-blockchain token.\n' +
    'BETS tokens will be traded across all the selected blockchains after the expansion. All the bets in our ' +
    'ecosystem will be made in BETS token, which means that you will be able to independently transfer your game ' +
    'assets to another blockchain if you want to migrate to it. However, first we need to somehow distribute this ' +
    'token between all interested players.\n',
